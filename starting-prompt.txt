I want to create an API that uses language models and search services to gather information about professionals and the companies they work for.

Given a person's name, it should return a list of all companies they have worked for in their career, including their positions, major projects, their co-workers and the person they report to, comments about their performance, and any other information that can be found about their relation to the company.

Given a company, it should return 10 to 20 persons associated with it, along with a description of the company, its products, and its history. 

Given a company and a person as context, it should return people associated with the comopany who may have worked with the person.

The goal is to create a bipartite graph of these connections.  Every person is connected to companies, and every company is connected to persons, but persons are not directly connected to each other and companies are not directly connected to each other.  The graph is formed dynamically by gathering information one person or one company at a time.

There should be a way to change models and search services.  The keys for several models are in .env.local, including these five: 

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

OPENAI_API_KEY

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY

GEMINI_API_KEY

EXA_API_KEY

The .env.local file also as a DATABASE_URL for postgres.  Use it without an ORM, using SQL statements.

Test the API using John Dimm and Rick Moy as persons and Websense as company.

The UI created for Constellations by John Dimm is very good. 

Use photos for people and when possible logos for companies.

Use exa search among other search services.

The idea is to use this for people who are not famous!  Many of them will have linkedin pages, and if it is possible to use linkedin in some way please do.

For John Dimm, here is the google response.  Do not hard-code this.  It is provided to show what we need to be able to find in the api.
