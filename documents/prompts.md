# User Prompts — 2026-02-16

1. Implement the following plan: # Migrate from PostgreSQL to localStorage [detailed migration plan with 6 implementation steps]

2. no pictures, no logos

3. good for companies, but people all get the 'twitch' image instead of a photo. with Constellations, we get photos for both John Dimm and Rick Moy.

4. a search for 'websense logo' produces lots of images

5. when expanding a node, do it quietly. do not dim everything and pop up a box. just do the work and add it to the graph

6. You checked Constellations-antigravity. That is an old version. Try just Constellations.

7. Constellations finds this image for John Dimm [screenshot]

8. when I click a company, get a batch of people

9. avoid spreading the nodes out farther than needed

10. avoid overlapping text. split names across two lines if needed.

11. [Console error: "Unexpected token 'L', \"Looking th\"... is not valid JSON"]

12. the graph spins too much, often starts out very wide and then compresses. very busy

13. did you say a single click on an expanded company will request more people from it?

14. then let's try to get more on a second click

15. do not create a second node for the same company. or person.

16. I clicked Blue Titan a second time, got a few more people, but also got a second node for the same company with exactly the same name [screenshot]

17. create a documents directory and add a doc that summarizes all you have done today. Add a second doc that just lists all my prompts.
